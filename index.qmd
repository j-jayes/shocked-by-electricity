## Research question

How does getting access to new technology (electricity) impact your returns on the labour market, in terms of:

- income, 
- occupational choice, and 
- choice to migrate?

# Motivation{#sec-motivation background-color="#1C9E77"}

Test

## Electrification is a cannonical example of a **General Purpose Technology (GPT)**

We find that when this new technology was adopted in Sweden:

- It made individuals richer 💰🔋
- It lowered inequality 📉🤝
- It allowed structural change on the labor market 🔧💼
- It created new kinds of jobs 🤖👩‍🔧
- It benefitted those in the middle of the skill distribution 🎓🔌

## Why do we care about the second industrial revolution?

## What can we learn from this era of technological change?

1. New kinds of jobs were created with the new technology 🎛️👩‍💻

2. The new jobs were not necessarily high-skilled 🎓⬇️
    - learning by doing / on the job training 🧑‍🔧💡
    - creation of middle-skilled jobs 👨‍💼🔨

3. It met people where they were 📍🤝
    - the new jobs were created in the same areas as the old jobs 🏭➡️🏢

### Why is this time different? 🕰️🔄🤔
